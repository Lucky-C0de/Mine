This is a program designed to imitate a Hotel Management System, I've added some additional functionalities such as two types of users, viewing of rooms' map & status, and manage room status.

Admins and Customers; Admins can create, view, delete, update bookings and Manage room statuses. Customers can only make bookings.
What they have in common is that they can both view the room maps to visualize the rooms, and they can also both view bookings to see when a room is available

Note 1: Admin password is "admin123" lol :p

Note 2: When you manage rooms and change it's status you can see that it does change, but if you close the program and re-open it you can also see that the changes doesn't carry over
it is because I forgot to add a method to save the room's status to another separate .txt file and only noticed it as of now when I just uploaded the code, am I going to fix that? maybe
will I fix it as soon as I can? Idk, probably (won't, unless dept head asks me to). I am fairly new to the concept of FILE in C, but I do have experience in filereaders and bufferedwriters in Java

Note 3: I have used methods, define, struct, and const as I have some *minimal* experience in those, also from java. I tried to make it in one massive while loop in the main() but it got
confusing real quick so I decided to dabble in the mentioned above. I even tried to play with pointers but it also gave me headaches, so maybe in the future but not today. tried using time.h library too

Note 4: Idk if what I made is questionable since I have made this during the time I should be sleeping because I kind of crammed it because of work and church haha! that's all.
